I'm ArunVenkat C A, people call me Arun, AV, Boss.. (um, the list might just go too long).
This blog is a result of coalescing the idea of me being a "computer science and engineering" student and a passionate motorcyclist/traveller.


Motorcycling is the key here, I love motorcycles (well automobiles in general, but a lot more biased towards motorcycles!).
It's like watching a passing cloud, you never know where it came from and where it's going, but you experience it moving,
that's how I found out my passion for motorcycling, what serendipity!

Observing, detailing and giving you my opinion on what I experience or learn about is what this blog is majorly dedicated to.
I believe in sharing, inculcating or rather instilling beautiful ideologies and just beautiful things in general and I would like you to experience this passion of mine as I put it in words here.


This is Rambler Talez, a blog for all those motorcycle enthusiasts, travellers or even just avid readers out there!
