title: Motorycling Skills

Let's get this straight first, knowing how to start and move a motorcycle doesn't give you the qualification of a motorcyclist. Motorcycling is a journey, filled with loads of learnings and acquiring new skills endlessly. Most of the skills are self-acquired through practice. And no, I'm not talking about skills like popping wheelies on public roads and putting everyone around you in danger "You're just a hazard at that point".

I believe that we as a motorcycling community must grow and learn from each other. So, beating around the bush ain't an option. We'll discuss a few major topics in this blog.

1. Braking: Brakes are an essential tool on your motorcycle as it's what give you control over the entire machine. Understanding how your brakes work and using them efficiently are key to good control. People usually have this misconception that front brakes aren't to be used often whereas actually, it's the opposite. Front brakes help you stop incomparably better than rear ones and this is true for all motorcycles in general. It's because the weight of the motorcycle transfers to the front providing more traction upon the application of front brakes. There are different types of brakes like solid discs, floating discs, drum brakes, etc. which is a topic for another day.

2. Smooth downshifting: Downshifting in a motorcycle should be paid more attention to than upshifting. Upshifting de-stresses the engine and downshifting conversely gives more stress to the engine, especially when engine braking is adopted. During downshifting, it is crucial to keep in mind not to lower gears when the engine is at a high rpm at the higher gear. Doing this for a long time can cause excessive wear of the engine parts. Techniques like rev-matching can help in shifting quickly or aggressively without any issues. In most high-end machines, tools like auto-blipper achieve this without the need to rev-match manually although having this as a skill can boost confidence.

3. Riding tall bikes as a short person: This may not be germane to this topic, but it's rather important. How many times have you discarded the idea of riding or having a tall bike just because you thought it was 'too tall for you'? Well, just as with any motorcycling skill, riding tall bikes as a short person is a skill to be acquired. There are many tips like learning to stop with a slight lean or with one strong foot rather than both. Mounting and dismounting on tall bikes are a skill too.

When you upgrade to a bigger bike, you don't unlock something better until you acquire the skill to extract the bike's potential. There might be much left for you to squeeze out from your motorcycle too! Life's all about learnings, isn't it?

Keep exploring and keep learning, this is all for this blog and I hope to see you in the next one!

Ride big, Ride safe!
