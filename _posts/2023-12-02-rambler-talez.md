Riding is what we love to do as motorcyclists. After all, that is why we chase motorcycles and the dreams we build around them. It is what we call soul-touching, to go to new places and meet new faces. This is a post on one such beautiful ride I partook in with a friend.

A ride should be calm and invigorating and so it shouldn't involve any issues that may lead it to be otherwise. Early morning is the best time to leave as the roads will be free of commotion. It was around 4 on a Sunday morning, I got myself ready for the ride and made sure the bike was ready too. It was around 5 when we finished taking a couple of photos documenting the ride and set off to the highway.

The cold gusts of wind and foggy landscape welcomed us with open arms. The roar of the engine was all that one could listen to as I whooshed through empty streets. It was a symphony to the ears as if the motorcycle was humming along enjoying the ride as much as I did.

We were going to Bidadi to have some "thatte-idli" which is a famous dish in that locality. Well, that was just a mere excuse to go on a long ride, this was after all my first long ride! Taking the NICE road was the best choice as it would have been taxing to go through the city. The wide winding roads were a charm as I just glided along with ease. Exiting NICE road, we were in for some amazing twisted and narrow roads. What a treat!

We saw a few other motorcyclists on the way who were probably just like us enjoying the Sunday morning on the saddles of their motorcycles. They were much more experienced and keeping up with their pace itself was a challenge on it's own which made me realize how much of a big journey lies ahead of me in being a motorcyclist. It was nice to see fellow passionate motorcyclists! 

Reaching the restaurant, we saw that the place was already crowded, and it was only half past 6 a.m. We found a place to sit, got our orders, and had a refreshing and satisfying breakfast. It was worth it to have gone all the way for that! Chilly mornings and breakfasts like this were a whole different experience that was just fabulous!
Riding back, we were back to our abodes in no time, and parking my bike at the usual spot, I looked back and felt a sense of gratitude to the machine. It was truly wholesome, I must say!

It was an amazing ride, filled with beautiful moments, delicious food, and a lot of pictures to watch and reminisce about. We all have something in our lives that we do to fill our hearts and, this is how I do it!

Thanks for reading, I'll be posting more about my rides soon!

Ride Big, Ride Safe!
