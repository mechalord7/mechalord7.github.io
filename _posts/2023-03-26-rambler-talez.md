Have you ever wondered about the people that excel at different types of riding motorcycles like trail-riding, racing, etc.? If yes, then have you wondered about how many different ways of riding a bike there are? 
This ain't about motorcycles, it's about how we adapt to different terrains and environmental conditions. Okay, let's give it a thought, how many times have we gotten annoyed by the fact that we were stuck in traffic during blazing afternoon hours? or how many times have we shied away from the thought of riding off-tarmac?
Many topics like these involve us (yes, you and me) in recognizing and adapting to the different ways of riding, just by improving our skills.
Let's start with a few:

1. City Riding: They can be calm, frustrating, or hurried depending on how you perceive your surroundings. I'm sure that most of us have had really bad experiences of waiting in traffic under the scorching summer heat, but how have we taken steps to avoid them? I'll go through some of mine. Covering your skin even if you do not own proper riding gear is crucial as it can help in avoiding minor scratches and help in avoiding sunburns. That's also the reason why people in really hot areas like deserts, cover themselves up with light clothing. Although cotton helps in breathability, it doesn't do much once it's drenched in moisture. Polyester on the other hand helps in easy evaporation thanks to its wicking property. This is one of the few reasons why sportswear is made of polyester.
Keeping a cool head is also vital while riding through the city. Never let your frustration take over as it can only lead to dire consequences.

2. Highway Riding: We dream of riding through stretches of tarmac that seemingly never end, and highways are closest to such. Easy and flowy as they may be, they can also be tiring and boring in the long run. How do we go about that? Simple, change your pace at intervals, take breaks to break rhythm and you will realize that a long ride can be broken into multiple short fun rides. Pretty much how I'm writing this blog XD. Also, be sure to check every part of your motorcycle before a long ride, for example, tire pressures (although you must be checking them regularly), engine oil, brake fluid, engine coolant (if required), and proper riding gear. 

There are others where I have little to no experience at all, for instance:

1. Track Riding: An open track removes any kind of unnecessary obstacles for a motorcyclist to learn new things. It's something I'm looking forward to doing soon. It's just like they say, "You think you're fast? Come to the track and you'll know how many are way faster than you and safer too while doing so.". It's gonna be an expensive way to learn, but we value our skills and safety more than anything right?

2. Trail Riding: I have no clue as to how to go about blitzing through trails or dirt tracks. It's a whole different world. You lose all thoughts about how you ride a bike on the tarmac right before you enter the trail. It can be quite unnerving, but isn't everything before we've tried it out? Power slides, log riding, etc. They seem to be so much fun.

3. Flat Track Racing: This is just a completely weird way of riding a motorcycle, I would say. You turn left to go right? On cars, okay, but motorcycles?! 

There are so many more, and learning just a few of them can give us immense confidence in our everyday commutes or occasional rides. Improving one's skill set has never been better with the kind of outreach, present in our era. So, let's get out there and ride. I would like to hear from you about such different riding experiences. This is after all a community for us to learn and grow!
