A notification popped up! Royal Enfield just brought a scrambler-like motorcycle to their line-up. Note the part "scrambler-like" used here, the scram 411 was more like an alter ego to a motorcycle that is coveted by many, the Himalayan. 
A few days later I went to a nearby Royal Enfield dealership with a friend of mine who, just like me, was keen on testing out the scram. We went there in the afternoon and enquired about the motorcycle with the folks at the store. A test unit with the graphite yellow paint scheme was available there. It was akin to the Himalayan, apart from the fact that it had a smaller front wheel, lower front suspension, and a color scheme that bested any other Royal Enfield bike at the time. It was supposed to be 'youthful' or such was the claim by the guys at RE. 'Youthful looks, but seems uncalled for', was what crossed my mind. 


Let's take it for a spin and see, I told my friend. He hopped onto the motorcycle and rode off, a few minutes later I ascertained that he loved the experience as he came back with a grin. This is gonna be worthwhile, I thought. Fastening my helmet lock, I walked towards the bike clearing my head of any preconceived notions. 
Hopping onto the saddle, the lower seat height was very evident. The engine tune felt different, it was surprisingly peppy, and being a sibling to the Himalayan, it was predictably torquey. Interesting! The bike chugged with ease.

It felt short, the ride was over in a trice, and yet it didn't feel hurried. For the time I was on the bike, I zipped through with ease in moving traffic. It was great, but the thoughts sank in later. A motorcycle based out of the Himalayan came with its expectations and well, did it meet them? I was not very sure.
I know quite a few motorcyclists and every one of them says only one thing, myself included, "Get the motorcycle that makes your heart skip a beat, a motorcycle that talks to you and you feel is right for you!". In that sense, I loved the scram and I would love to ride it more, but if you ask me if by any means I would get one, it would unequivocally be a nix.


Well, looking at the bright side, I am eagerly waiting for the launch of the Himalayan 450, and I'm sure that it'll be rolled out with huge expectations. 
I'm happy to have had an opportunity to ride the Scram and I hope to ride many more interesting motorcycles.
Dream big! Ride safe!
