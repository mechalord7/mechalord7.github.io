Just another mundane day filled with prosaic activities, that was how it went until I got a call, a call from a friend. If you've read the previous post, then yes, this is the same friend of mine who had come to test the Scram. This time around the occasion was different. "U free? Let's go to the RE showroom", he said and I thought "again?". The scram post was one that was out of time but right on emotion, but why not make a post about something that's the talk of the town? and that's what led to this post.

A 180 kilo light and small motorcycle "for RE standards" that is light not just on the road but on your pocket too? It is a sure way to capture attention! The Hunter 350 did not shy away from flaunting its curves and what a good-looking motorcycle that one is! If RE was aiming for youthful looks, this one, they got it right but does it translate to a youthful, power-packed experience on the tarmac? The 17-inch wheels, capable chassis, and engine did say so on paper.

Switching the ignition on, the motorcycle roared or rather 'rumbled' to life! The distinctive crisp and clear thump was soothing to the ears, a familiar one from the classic reborn and the meteor 350. Swinging a leg over, the small stature of the motorcycle was apparent. A short wheelbase, higher set foot pegs, and an overall sporty ergonomics triangle promised a fun ride. I was excited!

I set off eagerly and the first thing that struck me was the change in the engine map that distinguished this from the classic and the meteor. It was peppy, it felt like it would zip rather than chug along and it did. This was a thoroughbred street motorcycle meant for the urban jungle. And the 17-inch front! Oh, it inspired great confidence around corners and was just right for smooth tarmac. Well, the rake angle was a bit off, but I loved the refinement in the engine and the linear power delivery although it felt lacking at the top end.

Brakes! They were progressively great but initially not so much and the tyres just felt like they were not on par with the chassis. The chassis was beautiful! It helped handle the motorcycle like a charm, making it agile and nimble, something that it is not quite associated with Royal Enfield.
We had a great time with the motorcycle and overall I think this different approach from royal Enfield was unique but not necessarily the approach they needed, don't get me wrong though, the motorcycle was great. 

An urban jungle hunter that loses its prowess in long stretches of tarmac, that's how I would give it a one-liner.
A big thanks and full credit to my friend Sai for the amazing photos!
