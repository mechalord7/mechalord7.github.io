I'm a classic 350 owner and steady cruising or chugging along beautiful straights is my forte. If you had come to me and told me to get a little bolder on bad roads, I would've hesitated. Well, not this time! I had with me a Hero Xpulse 200 4v! The name's quite long but not as much as the apache series xD. 
First impressions: The bike looked great! Narrow, sleek, and with a premeditated build. Getting onto the saddle, the first thing I noticed was the narrow seat which discarded any presumptions related to the seat height. It was light to move around tight spaces too! Well, that's what you would expect from someone who handles a 200-kilo motorcycle on a day-to-day basis, and um that's me :). The bike was a charm to ride and it took me hardly a few minutes of riding to get used to it, although the one I got was revving out quite a bit sooner than I expected.

Let's talk about three things the Xpulse did great:

1. Beginner-friendly: The motorcycle was forgiving in nature and that, I think makes it beginner-friendly. It was light and confidence-inspiring. Chaps who haven't experienced off-roading would love it on this bike, it's done with so much ease! At around 1.4 lakhs ex-showroom, the motorcycle offers a great deal for those who're beginning to explore off-roading. With a consumer-claimed mileage of 45kmpl and with a service network as big as Hero's, the motorcycle would run for a long time without burning a hole in your pocket!

2. Suspension and ground clearance: Oh! It was beautiful, just remarkable I would say. I rode the motorcycle on broken roads, loose gravel, and speed breakers and it just flowed like a gushing current of air! It felt as if it could go through absolutely anything I threw at it. The bike was a big change of pace for me in this aspect.

3. Refinement: A 200cc single would straight away be presumed as sluggish and vibey. Not in this one, the engine was smooth and with a tune so on-point, it sounded and rode admirably. It starts getting dull at the top, but that's just me, expecting too much.

Two issues I thought could've been better were:

1. Brakes: They were good but not amazing, they lacked the initial bite and feel. They were progressively good. 

2. Gear indicator and instrument console: This might be different from others, but I thought the instrument console was a bit weird and cluttered. The gear position indicator did not do a great job either, messing up every time the clutch was engaged.

Nevertheless, the motorcycle was a great one. I was just so happy on the motorcycle for whatever little time I rode it. I may not be an offroad person but this motorcycle made me rethink that. This is a motorcycle I would indisputably have as a second bike!
Big thanks to Raju Bhai for lending his motorcycle!
