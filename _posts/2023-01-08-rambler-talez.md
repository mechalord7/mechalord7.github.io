A sheet of paper containing the details of the motorcycles that Royal Enfield sold was handed to me. Dad asked, 'what do you think?'. With no hesitation, my fingers pointing to the classic 350 indicated that that was the bike I wanted. Hopes weren't high but dad had his plans. Three long months later, I was standing right in front of my colony gate, and parked beside it was my dream in its physical form.


Motorcycles are what represent the motorcyclist. A name would be necessary, I thought. Heavy like a tank and simple as it was, Tauro found its loved name.
With around 20 hp, 28 Nm of torque, and a substantial 194 kg, the power-to-weight ratio paired up with a simple torquey engine tune meant it was slow, but that is not why the classic 350 remains royal enfield's trump card. It's the easiness and calm nature of the motorcycle that surprises you. The bike would just pull and pull, it was fascinating to ride with so much ease at higher gears. A single downtube frame for the chassis meant vibrations, but all that just contributed to the character of the bike. And the looks! The classic has always looked amazing, "Subtle yet amazing". True to its motto, the classic is built like a gun!

You may be fast but on the classic, you will love the occasional calm rides. The bike stands true to its nature, giving the rider the joy of riding and enjoying the journey as it is. That's the charm of it. It is an astonishingly beginner-friendly bike, well that is if you can manage the weight. 
Tauro was one of the very last carburetor-engine-powered bs4 classic 350 to roll out from the company before they moved to bs6-compliant fuel-injected bikes.

Tauro was the first ever motorcycle I rode and after all this time, I can't imagine a carefree and easy ride without Tauro. I'm probably getting too attached to it, but that doesn't matter because Tauro is just that special!
Ever since I got my driving license I've gone on many short rides and a few long ones too. I would love to share them with you, but that's a topic for another day!

This was about Tauro, my first ever bike and as I journey through life as a motorcyclist, I hope to ride more motorcycles and own a few, sharing every experience here.
