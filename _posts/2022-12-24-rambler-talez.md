Let's see, this was probably somewhere around when I was 8. I was a kid just getting the knack of riding around on two wheels and loving the experience. I used to think that bicycles were invincible and I rode them everywhere I thought the bicycle could go: gravel, mud, tarmac, I got myself bruised and splashed with the dirt during the process. The chain would go loose or a tyre would get punctured much more often than it should have and it was probably my worst worry then. I thought to myself, "let's try removing and fixing back a few parts on the bicycle", acting as if I were a skilled mechanic. Flimsy as it was, I did manage to remove the rear wheel! Fixing it back was a challenge though. Riding was and is fun! It was never a bad or a good day for as long as I rode my bicycle, I felt the happiest.

Looking back, that was probably the start of how I would later go on dreaming and chasing motorcycles. Close your eyes and imagine having a fuel-guzzling engine rumbling as the throttle is kept wide open and you envision yourself going into the horizon, sounds beautiful, doesn't it? The feeling of cutting through corners and moving through the imaginary aether as if you were a knife through hot butter was just exhilarating.
Anything and everything I did was somehow oriented at me moving toward motorcycles and cars. The yearning for the freedom of movement and for the magic in it was deep, so deep that it hasn't changed one bit after more than 10 years.

Fast forward to when I was in 6th or 7th standard, I was in the back of an auto-rickshaw riding along the insides of Bangalore city, facing the opposite side of the road filled with moving traffic, admiring the view of motorcycles and cars zipping away. Little did I know that the moment to come would shape my motorcycling journey forever. It seemed like a faint red dot from afar, approaching with a peculiar yet familiar silhouette and with a beautiful, distinct engine thump, the sight of which came dawning upon me with emotions so powerful yet with so much subtleness. It was the first time I saw the then-newly launched Royal Enfield Classic 350 Redditch Red. It felt like a dream, to own and ride one.

A 500 would be too much for a beginner, well that's what I thought then. I thought the classic 350 would be just perfect.
Early November 2017 was when Tauro came into my life, and since then it's all been like a fairytale. Riding, dreaming, going to places I couldn't go before, it's what I had dreamt and this just makes me want to dream more. To dream of places and motorcycles. It would never hurt me to always have one more motorcycle! It's been 5 years, and Tauro still never fails to put a smile on my face! Every commute, every ride, every mile, and every corner is a new experience with Tauro that I cherish.

I'm learning loads with Tauro and each learning is another step in the journey of me becoming a serious motorcyclist, carrying my passion forward as I become a part of the motorcycling community.

This was quite special as this is my first post on 'Rambler Talez'. I'll be talking to you through these posts, and I would like to know what you think about motorcycles and dreams, the stories that are made of dreams!

Dream Big and Ride Safe!
