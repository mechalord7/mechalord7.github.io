Safety. This is so accustomed to cars and the ones who own them that they don't even realize how much of a crucial role it plays in everyday drives. In bikes, this is not the case, you are vulnerable and the acceptance or awareness of that thought is what makes a biker mature into a motorcyclist. This is not about cars or bikes, this is about you and me, the ones who ride or drive. It doesn't matter if you are behind a steering wheel or a handlebar, what you do on the road is what matters the most. Let's see how

We'll be discussing three things in general:
**Helmets**: I'm a passionate motorcyclist and I would like to start this off with a note on those who ride motorcycles. Most novice riders, just don't seem to be aware or are just not all the more worried about how precious their safety is and how much effort and time they should be investing in it. Let's see, this thought is mostly accompanied by the mentality of "I ride well and I know I'm safe" whereas reality is just not that, no matter the skills and confidence in you, if you do value your tomorrow, wearing a decent helmet shouldn't be a concern. It's the opposite. You should be concerned about riding without proper gear.
Out on the road, cars are designed to keep you safe, on bikes, it's the precautions you take that play a key role. If you could slide your helmet through your elbow, you might as well slide it onto your head! Riding gear is just as essential as having fuel on the motorcycle. It's more like a safety net, something that keeps you out of the constant worry of bruising yourself and helps you focus more on the ride. Worry free! That's how a ride should be, right?
Get the best riding gear you can afford as it is an investment, an investment on yourself!

**Fast versus rash**: This is a very misunderstood topic. 'Fast' is just as immediately accompanied by its preconceived synonym 'rash' as 'unique' is to 'special'. You see, fast is a way of movement, it's smooth, it's clear, it's calm. Whereas this is not the case with 'rash'. 'Rash' is usually just the lack of clear perception, reflexes, or riding on the edge of a knife all the time. A motorcyclist is termed fast when he takes into consideration his surroundings, his limited skill, and the ability to perceive clearly what his next move is. Rash has nothing to do with any of this, it's just adrenaline all the way, so much so that it not just harms the rider but everyone else on the road too. 
Being responsible on the road is crucial and achieving this efficiently helps you move faster. This is accompanied by the feeling of not realizing that you are going too fast, it's calm and serene. You become a swift current, cutting through the rocks carefully aligning yourself in the right direction.

**Maintenance**: As petrolheads, we must be paying attention to our cars and motorcycles. Listen to them, understand what they need and what you need to make the ride all the more pleasant and stress-free. A well-maintained and cared-for motorcycle will function just as new as it left the showroom. It's just like any relationship, you put a decent amount of effort and time into caring for it and maintaining it. This is analogous to the relationship between you and your motorcycle or car. Keep them well-serviced and clean. To me, watching my bike shine after a good wash is just absolutely wonderful. I've had my fair share of dusty rides too!

This post was focused on how small things that we don't usually pay heed to, can make quite a big difference in the way you ride. Another point that I consider an honorable mention is 'control'. My control of the motorcycle shows me my limit and how much my skills need to improve to push it higher. 
All this is just to ensure everyone out there is safe! Safe means worry-free, worry-free means faster, and faster means smoother!
I would like you to tell me what your opinions and stories related to vehicle safety are. Let me know what you think, coz this is a place for us to learn and grow as budding enthusiasts and considerate people!

Ride Safe! and Happy new year in advance!
